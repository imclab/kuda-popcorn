Kuda Published Content

Thank you for using the Kuda World Editor to publish your WebGL project! To make
your content available to others, you may use the provided html file which has
been packaged with *almost* everything it needs to be viewed on the web. If you
wish to embed your content into an existing html page, it only takes two steps:

- copy the script tags into the top of your html file
- copy the kuda div tag into your html file where you want the content to appear

NOTE: If you move the provided html file out of the package directory or embed
your content in a file in a different directory, you may have to check the paths
on the script files as well as the Hemi load path. These paths are currently
defined relative to the package directory and would need to be updated if they
were referenced from another location.

You're almost ready. In order to help keep the package size down and make
publishing faster, we don't include any 3D model files in the package. If your
project includes any models, you'll need to copy the model files into the
'assets' directory yourself. It looks like you need the following models:
